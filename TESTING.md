## Manual Testing

Throughout the development process Chrome was used to test for functionality and Chrome developer tools for layout and responsiveness on various screen sizes. Once deployed, the site was also tested on Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers and on both android and iOS mobiles.

After sign-off, structured manual testing of the site was carried out on various browsers and screens sizes. A detailed plan was followed to ensure code was thoroughly tested.

## Bug Log

1. **Heroku CSS Updates** During development it became apparent that CSS updates were not being reflected in Heroku deployments. The solution from Stack Overflow was to restart Heroku in the terminal `Heroku restart -a coderbeez-qwerty` .
